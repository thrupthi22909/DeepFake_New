    <h2>ℹ️ About DeepFake Detector</h2>
    <p style="margin-top:20px; font-size:18px;">
      DeepFakes use AI to manipulate videos and images, making it difficult 
      to distinguish between real and fake. Our system leverages advanced 
      deep learning models to analyze facial features, pixel inconsistencies, 
      and motion patterns to detect manipulation.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top:15px; font-size:18px;">
      Upload an image or video, and the AI will classify it as 
      <strong>Real</strong> or <strong>Fake</strong> with a confidence score.
